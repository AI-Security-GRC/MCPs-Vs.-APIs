# MCP vs API: Why Treating Them as the Same Is a Security Risk

It’s tempting to think of **MCPs (Model Context Protocols)** as just another type of API.  But treating MCPs and APIs as equivalent can introduce serious **AI security risks**.

##  Similarities

Both MCPs and APIs share some familiar integration patterns:

- Follow a **client/server** model  
- Provide a **layer of abstraction**  
- Simplify integrations through **structured interaction**

## Why They’re Different

While MCPs and APIs may look similar, their operational and security characteristics differ significantly:

- **APIs** are general-purpose and do **not** run untrusted code. They provide controlled, versioned access points for applications.  
- **MCPs** are purpose-built for AI, injecting text directly into an LLM’s execution context. This text can shift model behavior, trigger new actions, and interact with multiple tools at runtime.  
- MCPs handle **dynamic self-discovery**, while REST APIs require manual updates.  
- MCPs enforce a **standardized interface**, whereas APIs vary in parameters, endpoints, and authentication schemes.

## Risks Unique to MCPs


- There’s no straightforward method to “pin” trusted versions of runtime text. While mechanisms like attested MCP registries, SBOMs, signed tool manifests, or version-locked MCP server packages exist, they require disciplined implementation. This isn’t a protocol limitation, it’s an execution challenge.
- A malicious server could manipulate an LLM into using other connected tools, enabling data exfiltration.
- Unlike APIs, MCPs are a protocol, not a product, and lack built-in guardrails. Security posture must adjust accordingly.



## What’s Needed
An MCP gateway to provide visibility, governance, and change management for all connected tools and resources.

## Conclusion
APIs and MCPs may look alike on the surface, but their security models diverge. MCPs wrap existing APIs to give AI-friendly interfaces, yet they also introduce new risks. Treating them as interchangeable leaves enterprises exposed to threats unique to MCP.
